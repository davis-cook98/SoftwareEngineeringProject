Our vision for this project is to make a reccomendation algorithm that helps students, faculty, and administrators see what resources our
school has access to. It will be able to track where we got the source from, where it is now, what kind of media it is (text, database 
subscription, movie, etc.), and who had it last. It will also offer more in depth controls for people with higher access levels.
