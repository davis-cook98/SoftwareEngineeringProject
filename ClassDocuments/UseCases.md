# Use Cases
These are the use cases that we have identified for our reccomender system.
## User 
- As a user, I will want to be able to see articles relating to the preferences that I have specified, so that I do not have to enter them each time I log on. I can feel confident that this happens if I do not have to input my preferences each time I log in.
- As a user, I want to be able to update my preferences, allowing me to update my interests as they change. I can feel confident that this happens if there is a screen/tab to update my preferences.
## Administrative User
- As an administrative user, I want to be able to see the queries that are run by the reccomender system, allowing me to debug the system for certain queries. I will feel that this is implemented if there is a feed for debug messages.
## System
- The system will recieve information from many different sources. This will allow for a variety of information for the user. I will feel confident that this happnens if the feed is populated with news articles and there are no error messages.
- The system will filter the articles that it recieves by the user's preferences. This allows for the user to have a better experience with the product. I will feel confident that this is working if the user recieves only relevant information.
