# Product Vision
The vision for the product is that we will create a service that reccomends articles on colleges to the users.
These reccomendations can be tailored to what the user wants via filters that the user can set. Some of these filters include:
schools of interest, majors, or really any keyword they want. We will also push articles that are deemed important to all users. Some of these would include if a school they are interested in has a scandal or if new school rankings come out. Also displayed next to the schools will be the current sentiment about the school taken from Twitter and the net price of attending the school taken from the US Department of Education. The way that we will aggregate the feed of artices is a combination of scrapers and RSS feeds.
