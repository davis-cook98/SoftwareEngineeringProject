# Business Case
The plan for this project is to build a service that:
- Students/ Parents
- Commuinty Groups
- School Officials

can use to look at and compare schools. They will have to sign up for the website and will get information tailored 
to which group they say they belong to.

They will be able to look at:
- News related to certain schools 
- News related to  a certain topic or major
- How schools are rated by different publications

along with custom filters that they can set and will be saved along with their profile. This will allow for the 
user to get only the information that they want to see.
