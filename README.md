## Stack
This project will use:
- MongoDB: A NoSQL database that uses a json-like structure. We chose this because, with our preferences, there will be many fields that are not populated for some users, and some that require multiple entries. A non-relational database seemed perfect for this task.
- Flask: We will be making two Flask APIs, one for read and one for write. These APIs will communicate with our React front end.
- React: We have our frontend for the project in React. React is a top js framework and will allow us to make a great web app with ease. 

## Commands to install:
This project usese pipenv for package management, removing the use for a requirements.txt file and making version control easier.
1. install python 3+
2. run `pip install pipenv` in the command line
3. `cd /path/to/project`
4. `pipenv install` 
5. `cd /frontend`
6. `npm install`
7. And your done :D
